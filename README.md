# ShouldIUseAnAccordion.com

This is the repository for https://shouldiuseanaccordion.com/ This project is to help raise awareness of when to not use an accordion and why, backed with links to reputable research. It is intended to be an entertaining and informative caricature of how accordions are used in a less optimal way.

## Contributing

If you have things to add to the list or can explain some of the downfalls of accordions or collapsables, pull requests are welcome. Also, PRs for better accessibility and simplyfying the code are welcome as well.

This is a side-project that I would like to be as set-it and forget-it as I can make it. So, we're opting for no frameworks, dependency management, or backend junk that may need security updates and API changes. Just pure HTML and CSS. Not even Javascript, if we can get away with that. If that works for you, feel free to suggest improvemets by opening pull requests.
